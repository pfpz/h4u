	<h3>At the time of writing this I am 18 years old and was raised in Philadelphia, PA, I began suffering with my mental health when I was no older than 7. I experienced my first traumatic experience when my grandma died, she was like a second mother to me. It was hard to accept that she had passed but I had accepted at some point. Growing up I never had much but what I did have I loved, alot. My parents weren't the rich and I didn't have every toy in the world but I was happy for the toys and for the things my parents always somehow were able to get me. My mom always worked little odd jobs and random gigs but twice she ended up managing some local fast food chains, one being a Domino's and the other being a McDonalds, she also worked for a while at a gas station called Exxon. She worked her hardest to support me, my sister and my brother. My dad was a truck driver, never really being home, but when he was he would spend every second with us. We would take walks in the park, ride bikes, play with my toys, look at his hot wheels collections and so much other things. When I was only 9 years old, I was spending a night at my friends house, he was 12 years old and had been teaching me how to skate and how to play a few games on PS3 so I thought a night over at his house would be nice. We had begun to watch a movie and were about to play one of the games he had been teaching me how to play. Before we played the game he had asked me if I had "ever done the stuff" with any girls yet, and me being 9 years old I obviously had said no. He then asked if I wanted to test it out and I told him no, but he kept insisting to which I kept denying and then he forced me into doing what he wanted. I will spare you the details but it was awful, I hated every second of it. When he was doing it, his mom knocked on his door to ask what was all the loud noise and caught him in the act. She started to flip on him to which he then started to quite literally beat his mom until she was asking for my help, I couldn't do anything though, I was only 9 years old. When they were fighting, I packed all my things that I brought with me, one of those belongings being this pillow pet that my sister had given me, which I loved with everything in me and brought with me everywhere. After I finished packing my stuff, I could overhear him telling his mom that I asked him to s*ck my d*ck, which I obviously didn't. He then came storming out of his room and found me packing my things and started to go balistic that I was leaving. He grabbed my bag full of belongings and ripped it open, as everything went flying he picked up everything that he could and tried his hardest to destroy it. He grabbed my beloved little pillow pet and cut it open with scissors and then started to pour all types of different seasonings and things he could find in his kitchen, which destroyed it, destroying me. His mom called my dad and he came and picked me up. While my dad was out front, I was picking up everything that I could while crying my little eyes out, hoping for any release from this pain. The "friend" had then went outside without me knowing and told my dad the same thing that he had told his mom, that I asked for it. My dad didn't believe him obviously, I was 9, so when I got in the truck with my dad he asked if he had touched me but I couldn't answer. I sat there frozen, crying, the entire way back to my house. I've never told anyone but my sister and my girlfriend the whole story. A few months after that happened, I was out with my sister and her friends when my mom had told me that someone got hit by a car only right up the street. We all walked up there to check it out, only to find out it was that "friend's" brother. That night I was filled with so many emotions and so much guilt, I felt as thought he was owed some condolonces for the loss of his brother but I never wanted to see him or speak to him again after what he did, and making the decision of not giving him my condolonces made me feel so god damn guilty. The next day I went and saw him and gave him my condolonces, but it was so weird because he was acting like he never did anything and he was acting the exact same as he was from before that happened. After that day I only saw him once, in a walmart, and I punched him. I'd like to say what he did was the source for most if not all of my mental illness growing up but honestly he's not. The cause for most of my mental health is the internet, from a young age I've had uncensored access to the internet leading me to develop several harmful addicitions and habits at such a young age. I was only 10 years old when I watched best gore for the first time, and it was so bad man. I remember being added into my first kik group chat, and being groomed by multiple older men and women when I was only 11-12. I remember first learning about hacking and how to access other peoples info without their knowledge, I thought it was so cool, but looking back on my younger self I was a total jackass. I would constantly steal my grandparents debit card information to buy V-Bucks or like this one time I hacked into my parents PayPal and transfered like $100 to my PayPal and also went on a little shopping spree. Having uncensored access to the internet has definitely had a serious impact on my outcome in life. But even then thats not even completely what has formed me into the person I am, or was. When I was only 9 years old is when I began experimenting with substances, but not anything hard, it was only nicotine lmao. But at 9 years old, nicotine is severely damaging, and I was already addicted. I began by only stealing a cigarette or two out my moms pack, hiding them in my room and smoking them very little by little over a week or 2. Which is not alot at all but then soon, by time I was 11, I was already smoking half a pack every 4 days. And by 15 I was at a pack a day. Though, by 11, I had already began experimenting in other substances, such as alcohol, percocets, xanax, marijuana, lean and adderall. It began when I was offered my first bit of weed by some of my local neigborhoodly friends and I declined the first few weeks of them offering, even telling one of my friends grandparents they had offered it. But eventually as all kids do, I broke, and I smoked my first blunt. Which then turned into smoking at that spot every week, and then smoking there everyday, then smoking by myself everyday. I was offered some xans by a kid who I was friends with and I took 1/4th of the bar which was enough for me, but soon that became and addiction which I was able to shake until I was 16. When I was 16, man it was rough. I was living alone in a completely abandoned and destroyed house, which was constantly rotting away. There was no fridge, no hot water, no food most of the time and it was littered with trash and animal feces. While living there, I was taking 2 xans, 12 percocets, 42 benadryl, atleast 12ml of lean, drinking heavily and doing all of that on an empty stomach, nearly everyday. While smoking, what I presume, was fake carts (Carts are a THC Based Derivitive inside of Vaporizer Device Cartridge). It was seriously lonely and I begain to suffer with paranoid schizophrenia and PTSD. I began to hear my family talking and speaking downstairs, even though I knew they were gone and I would start to see people in my house that weren't there. I still suffer to this day with so much but I really don't want to bore you with anymore details on my grogy life. I just want you to know that I relate and I understand your feelings, I'm a human just like you. I'm not a robot, I care about you, and that is why I made this. You are cared about, I love you :)</h3>
